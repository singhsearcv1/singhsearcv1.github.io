                    Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who might help us? Mom. you said the biggest problem in the universe is nobody helps each other. I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We'll find some other way.</p>

                    <p>Senator, we're making our final approach into Coruscant. Very good, Lieutenant. We made it. I guess I was wrong. There was no danger at all. Cord.
                    Excuse me. I'm in charge of security here, milady. And this is my home. I know it very well. That is why we're here. I think it would be wise if you took advantage of my knowledge in this instance. Sorry, milady.                       
                                          
                    Your mother's dead, son. Accept it. You're gonna have to stay here. These are good people, Padm√©.                       
                    Sorry, Master. I forgot you don't like flying. I don't mind flying, but what you're doing is suicide. Anakin! How many times have I told you-Ah!, Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Stay away from power couplings! That was good! Where are you going? He went that way.                       
                    But what senator would have the courage to propose such a radical amendment? If only, Senator Amidala were here. Mm. Traitor. Oh, no, my friend. This is a mistake, a terrible mistake. They have gone too far. This is madness.                       
                    But who and why, harder to answer. Meditate on this I will. Hmm. I wasn't the youngest queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough.

He's headed for that small moon.We're not clear yet! there's still 30 pallets of cannon shells in C bunker. Forget the ammunition, there's no time. Just get everyone on the transport. Oh no.
