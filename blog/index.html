Captain. Yes, sir? Tell them we wish to board at once. With all due respect, the Ambassadors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately. Yes, yes, of course, as you know, our blockade is perfectly legal, and we'd be happy to receive the Ambassador.
                    Viceroy, I don't want this stunted slim in my sight again. 
                   
                    Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who might help us? Mom. you said the biggest problem in the universe is nobody helps each other. I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We'll find some other way.</p>

                    Wait! Wait. Her Highness commands you to take her handmaiden with you. No more commands from Her Highness today, Captain. This spaceport is not going to be pleasant. The Queen wishes it. She is curious about this planet.                      
                                          
                    I'll make sure Mom doesn't sell you or anything. Sell me?!? Bye. I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it. Ani! Will I ever see you again? What does your heart tell you? I hope so. yes. I guess.

                    <p>Senator, we're making our final approach into Coruscant. Very good, Lieutenant. We made it. I guess I was wrong. There was no danger at all. Cord.
                    Excuse me. I'm in charge of security here, milady. And this is my home. I know it very well. That is why we're here. I think it would be wise if you took advantage of my knowledge in this instance. Sorry, milady.                       
                                          
                    Your mother's dead, son. Accept it. You're gonna have to stay here. These are good people, Padmé.                       
                    Sorry, Master. I forgot you don't like flying. I don't mind flying, but what you're doing is suicide. Anakin! How many times have I told you-Ah!, Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Stay away from power couplings! That was good! Where are you going? He went that way.                       
                    But what senator would have the courage to propose such a radical amendment? If only, Senator Amidala were here. Mm. Traitor. Oh, no, my friend. This is a mistake, a terrible mistake. They have gone too far. This is madness.                       
                    But who and why, harder to answer. Meditate on this I will. Hmm. I wasn't the youngest queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. 
                    Above the cosmic tableau, starships resembling angels hover in the expanse, piloted by Lego-built droids with wings fashioned from laser beams. This celestial ballet adds an ethereal touch to the galactic retelling, underlining the cosmic importance of the event. The Millennium Falcon, piloted by Han Solo and accompanied by Princess Leia, joins this celestial procession, symbolizing hope, joy, and the enduring magic of the Star Wars universe. Chewbacca, the towering Wookiee, stands as a sentinel of loyalty amidst this cosmic celebration, underscoring the idea that the Force transcends boundaries and species. His towering presence adds a touch of awe to the scene, reminding everyone that the Force unites beings from all corners of the galaxy.</p>
                    <p>Even the dark side of the Force finds its place in this festive display, with Darth Vader and a squad of Stormtroopers making an unexpected appearance. However, in this unique nativity, they symbolize the universal theme of redemption and the eventual triumph of light over darkness.

Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead the one crawling with vulture droids. I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.

                    And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be. But be patient, Anakin. It will not be long before the council makes you a Jedi master. Obi-Wan.
                        
                    Open all hatches. Extend all flaps and drag fins. We lost something. Not to worry. We are still flying half a ship. Now we're really picking up speed. Eight plus 60.
                        
                    He is here. We are being held hostage. They are watching us. I understand.
                        
                    Good. Just help me save Padmé's life. I can't live without her. To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret. I pledge myself, to your teachings.
                        
                    I can't see a thing. My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me. Anakin! Move to the right. Hold on.
                        
                    Wait for me until I return. Things will be different. I promise. Please, wait for me. Well, he is under a lot of stress, R2. Take care, my little friend. Oh, my lady, is there anything I might do? No, thank you, 3PO.
                        
                    Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we have begun our attack. Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions. Yes, Master. I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.
                        
                    Save your energy. I can't. Don't give up, Padmé. Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he? He came by this morning. What did he want? He's worried about you. He says you've been under a lot of stress.
                        
                    But you don't use them. Good, Anakin. Good. Kill him. Kill him now. I shouldn't. </p>

Their inclusion emphasizes the inclusive nature of the Force, reaching even the most remote corners of the galaxy.In the spirit of unity, the inhabitants of the cantina on Mos Eisley set aside their differences to partake in the cosmic celebration.
                        
                    Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge. Oh, I think I just blasted it. They're coming through! Here, hold this. Here they come! For luck! Where could they be? Close the blast doors! Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors! I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
                        
                    Hold up here and wait for my signal...to start your run. This is it! We should be able to see it by now. Keep your eyes open for those fighters! There's too much interference! Red Five, can you see them from where you are? No sign of any...wait! Coming in point three five. I see them. I'm in range. Target's coming up! Just hold them off for a few seconds.

                    How did my father die? A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. This will begin to make things right. I've traveled too far, and seen too much, to ignore the despair in the galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can be no balance in the Force. Well, because of you now we have a chance.

                    So you'd miss me. I did miss you. It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh? Some of it was...good. .
                    
                    Poe. Poe Dameron. You're alive! So are you! What happened to you? What happened? I got thrown from the crash, woke up at night -- no you, no ship, nothing-- BB-8 says that you saved him. No, no, no.
                    
                    Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you! Copy that! We're with you, Poe! Quick! Woohoo! YEAH! That's one helluva pilot! WOOHOO! The girl I've heard so much about. The droid. Where is it? Request air support! The map. You've seen it.
                    
                    Do you hear me? I'll come back for you! It will be alright. Stay here. Look how old you've become. Something far worse has happened to you. You know what I've come for. I know where you come from.
                    
                    That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true. My son is alive. No. The Supreme Leader is wise.
                    
                    You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion. You knew him. Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke. Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten LOOSE-- Wait -- a what?! Did you just say Rathtars? Hey! You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you? I'm hauling Rathtars. Oh great.
                    
                    I believe the time has come to use it. We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance, the Republic. Without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be vulnerable, and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker. Go.
                    
                    The fuel cells have ruptured. The collapse of the planet has begun. Leave the base at once and come to me with Kylo Ren. It is time to complete his training.
                    
                    Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth. What is it? What are you doing?! Come on! Come on, BB-8! Let go of me! No, we gotta move! I know how to run without you holding my hand! BB-8 stay close! This way! Call in the air strike! They're shooting at both of us! Yeah, they saw you with me! You're marked! Well, thanks for that! I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick! Does anyone have blasters around here?! Are you okay? Stop taking my hand! Hey! -- Are you okay? Yeah. Follow me. We can't outrun them! We might in that quad-jumper! We need a pilot! We've got one! You?! What about that ship? That one's garbage! The garbage'll do! Gunner position's down there! Y'ever fly this thing? No! This ship hasn't been flown in years! Great. </p>
                    <p>Not for long. A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own. Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us. Look at him. He's headed for that small moon.

                    I saw part of the message he was. I seem to have found it. General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. You could say. Do you speak Bocce? Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me, I'm as fluent in. All right shut up! I'll take this one. Rise in the Force. In the heart of a Jedi lies her strength. Rise. Rise. Rey, the Force will be with you, always. Let your death be the final word, in the story of rebellion.
                    Weak. Like your parents. My parents were strong. They saved me from you. Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees. I see it. Stay low. This is Red Five, I'm going in! Luke, pull up! Are you all right? I got a little cooked, but I'm okay. Amidst the whimsical festivities, a profound allegory emerges, portraying the eternal struggle between the Jedi and Sith as a metaphor for the timeless battle between light and darkness. This narrative depth adds a layer of meaning to the galactic celebration, inviting contemplation on the themes of good versus evil and the enduring hope embodied in the holiday season.</p>
